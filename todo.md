# TODO

1. Cmd+1,Cmd+2,Cmd+3 and so on should be a keyboard shortcut to easily between open tabs
2. The window should respect Apple's native window keyboard shortcuts eg function+Control+right arrow will move the window to the right side of the monitor and so on for the other native macOS shortcuts
3.When tabs are being used, double clicking on the tab title should allow you to rename the tab and save it when you press enter
